# stat-shiny-apps

A set of [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) apps demonstrating basic statistical concepts, including:

* Sampling
* Distributions
* Central Limit Theorem
* Confidence Intervals
* Regression

The apps were originally developed for an experimental R-based section of Elementary Statistical Methods (STAT 301) that I taught at Purdue University.
